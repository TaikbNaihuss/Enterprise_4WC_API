In "Full Walkthrough.mp4", you may have notices I only set the location once correctly
and it worked for all questions.
For the purposes of testing, all the questions had the same location. Just in case
you wondered why they were all correct despite me setting the location correctly once.

The "Hint Tests.mp4" was made as I forgot to show their functionality in the original "Full Walkthrough.mp4".

Also the HATEOAS responses in the video do not reflect the current implementation,
the previous submission was in March, since then this has been updated to contain 
the HTTP verb/ HTTP action that is associated with the endpoint.
